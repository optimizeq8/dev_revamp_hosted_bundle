These Advertising Policies apply to all ads served by Snap.</p>

We may update our terms, policies, and guidelines from time to time, so please check in and review them regularly.</p>

<p>Our user base includes teenagers (as young as 13), nonagenarians, and everyone in between. Advertisers are responsible for ensuring that their ads are suitable for Snapchatters ages 13+ in each geographic area where the ads will run. They're also responsible for ensuring that their ads comply with all applicable laws, industry codes, rules, and regulations in each geographic area where the ads will run.</p>

<p>All ads must meet high quality and editorial standards. Please visit the Specs and Creative Guidelines section of our <a href="https://businesshelp.snapchat.com/en-US/i-need-help">Business Help Center</a> for the technical and creative specifications for each of our ad products.</p>
